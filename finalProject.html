        <h2> Description & Technical Write-up</h2>
        <p>
            Path Lighter is a tool to help people safely navigate their home in the dark. The ultrasonic sensor
            can
            sense if someone walks by and
            automaitcally lights up their pathway for them. This is great for people who need to walk down the
            stairs in the middle of the night but don't want to turn on too many bright lights and completely wake
            themselves up (or their roomates) - Path Lighter only
            lights up what's necessary to be safe. <br> <br>The prototype works with an ultrasonic
            sensor and an
            LED light strip.
            The ultrasonic sensor is set to sense if someone is within 2-36 inches away from it and lights up
            the LED if someoene is sensed in that range (range can be modified if desired).
            The LED will then stay on for about 20 seconds (time can be modified if path is longer) while the
            user walks down the path. <br><br>

            In this image you can see the power supply, the ultrasonic sensor enclosed in a box, the LED strip,
            and the arduino and LED circuit which is also enclosed in a case.

            <br><br> See below for more detail on my circit, schematic and arduino code.

        <p> In this video you can see the prototype at work. The ultrasonic sensor sensed a person was a approaching and
            turned on the LED strip.
            The video demonstrates how the prototype works both in the dark and when it is light (because the sensor is
            ultrasonic and does not depend on light).
            The prototype is located at the bottom of the stair case and the LED strip runs up the stairs. Please ignore
            the cleaning spray on the stair case which is only used
            to hold up the LED strip.

        <h2> Image of My Circuit</h2>
        <img src="FinalCircuit.png" width=400></a>
        <p> This is a close up image of how I organized my circuit before I soldered the circuits onto perfboards and
            enclosed them in boxes. The final circuit was soldered together and enclosed
            in appropriate boxes which can
            be seen above in the prototype image. I used a 5K resistor for the LED strip to make sure the current was
            low enough and wouldn't fry anything.

        <h2> Schematic</h2>
        <img src="FinalSchem.png" width=700>
        <p> Above is my schematic for my Path Lighter final project. The LED strip is connected to power and the
            transistor. The transistor is connected to a resistor (which connects to Pin 10), the LED strip, and to
            ground.
            Power is connected to the LED strip and to ground. <br> <br>

            The ultrasonic sensor has 4 connections. VCC is connected to 5v on the arduino. GND on the sensor is
            connected to GND on the arduino. TRIG on the sensor is connected to
            pin 11 on the arduino and ECHO on the sensor is connected to pin12 on the arduino.

        <h2> Arduino Code</h2>
        <p> Below is the code used to control Path Lighter. The code begins by reading in data from the ultrasonic
            sensor. That data is then
            converted into inches (how many inches away the object is that the sensor is reading). Next, the inches are
            used in an if statemnt to control
            the LED's. If the sensor senses something between 2 and 36 inches then the LED's will stay on. Once on,
            there will be a delay for 20 seconds
            so that the lights stay on while the user is walking the path. If the sensor does not sense anything within
            2 and 36 inches, than the lights will stay off.
